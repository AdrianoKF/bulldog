Bulldog
=======

Bulldog is a GPIO API for the Beaglebone Black written in Java.

It is currently under development, but many features are already usable. If you're interested in the sources, visit the Devline1 branch. Yet, it is far from being a fully fledged API.

To achieve high pin toggling speeds and maximum performance, it uses VegetableAvenger's excellent BBIOlib: https://github.com/VegetableAvenger/BBBIOlib
The only working lib that was found for the 3.8 kernel!

Thanks VegetableAvenger!
